    [] tracking your current location
    [] tracking of number of pokemon in area
        [] adding a respawn time for escaped/caught pokemon to an area
[] pokemon giving coin when caught
[] a leveling system 
    [x] pokemon give 1/3 XP of their baseExperience to player when caught
    [] pokemon not caught should give some XP to player
    [] an exponential or teired XP neeeded to gain a level
        [] a bonus to the player for catching higher level pokemon
[] getting player Name?

    [] bonus for battles based on party pokemon type vs wild pokemon type
